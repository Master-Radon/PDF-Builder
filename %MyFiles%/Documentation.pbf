<h3>What's New?</h3></font>
<p>I added all EDIT, FORMAT, HELP and CONVERT menu, i added also all their options except Convert into PDF that i moved from File to Convert. I added templates, public documentation, 'What's new?' button in About. A better user guide (also i'll not explain you all buttons, you have to explore. And in the end i added also Reload Button in FILE menu, that will open the application again, so you can see changes</p>

<font color="blue"><h3>Why this Documentation is so tiny?</h3></font>
<p>Because you don't need to modify my code if not work with me. So why write something bigger that no one would read?</p>
